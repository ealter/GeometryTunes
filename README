Our team will develop a composition and performance tool that allows users to
create and edit a loops or sequences of notes by manipulating boxes on a large
rectangular grid. Many musical properties will be represented visually--colors
for pitches (and white for silence), and box size for note duration. Each of the
rectangles on the grid will have a center point that the path will snap to.
Users will draw paths from point to point and playback will follow the path
through the colored boxes it touches and play the sounds that the user assigns
to each box. Playback will initially treat each point on the path as a beat
but this can be changed at the userâ€™s whim. The primary goal of this
application will be to offer a new and innovative way to create musical loops
and sequences, represent this music with an expressive visual paradigm, and do
so with as little learning curve as possible.
