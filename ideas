This file is for ideas that we should discuss (not ready for todo list yet)

Make adding a note like tetris. You craft a note on the sidebar of the piano and
once you are ready, you swipe to push the note up to the grid. Once it is on the
grid, the note cannot be changed (though the whole square can be reset). To add
multiple notes at once, you use multitouch (i.e. 3 fingers to tap the whole
chord). You see the chord building on the right. This would remove the addNote
button (which would be replaced by multitouch).
