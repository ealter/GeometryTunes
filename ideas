This file is for ideas that we should discuss (not ready for todo list yet)

Make adding a note like tetris. You craft a note on the sidebar of the piano and
once you are ready, you swipe to push the note up to the grid. Once it is on the
grid, the note cannot be changed (though the whole square can be reset). To add
multiple notes at once, you use multitouch (i.e. 3 fingers to tap the whole
chord). You see the chord building on the right. This would remove the addNote
button (which would be replaced by multitouch).

Remove the grid. Change the notes to circles that you can place in arbitrary
space. The circles can overlap if you want them to do so (though the path would
only play the note that is visible). You would be able to move the notes by
dragging gestures.
  As a subidea, we could implement a small physics engine for the notes. 2 notes
  could collide and move/play their sounds (like knock hockey)

Instead of rewind and fastforward, use the speed slider. To get to a different
note, click on a note while the piece is playing to go to that note.

Speed slider goes on the top right of the screen and is always present

Instead of a grid, use an empty space. Users could draw a line from any point to
any other point. The lines would however be discrete in length (i.e. increments
of 10 or so pixels). The lines would represent the notes and instead of coloring
grid squares, we could color the lines. Therefore, the purpose of the app would
be to make pretty pictures that play your favorite song. The length of the line
would determine its duration. Each line would have a marker on both ends to
signify that the line ended.
